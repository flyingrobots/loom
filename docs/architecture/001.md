# 1. What is JITOS?

[ADR-0001: JIT as a Causal Operating System](../ADR/ADR-0001.md)

## 1.1 Overview

**JITOS** is a causal operating system built on the principle that:

> State is not a mutable object.
> State is a causal history.

In JITOS, the fundamental unit of reality is the Node—
an immutable, cryptographically hashed event in a directed acyclic graph (DAG).

The DAG is the substrate: a permanent, append-only ledger of all events.

Instead of mutating memory, JITOS allows agents to operate inside Shadow Working Sets (SWS)—isolated, subjective branches of the universe that collapse into truth through a deterministic commit (collapse) operator.

This architecture replaces:

- mutable files
- linear histories
- mutable in-place state
- global shared memory
- uncontrolled concurrency
- lossy logs
- trust-by-convention

with:

- immutable nodes
- causal structure
- observer-relative computation
- deterministic collapse
- perfect provenance
- total replayability
- cryptographic truth

JITOS is not a filesystem daemon.
Not a database.
Not “Git with extra steps.”
It is a kernel.

The first kernel whose storage model, process model, and execution model are all derived from a single unifying principle:

> Truth is causal.
> The past is immutable.
> Reality is append-only.

## 1.2 Purpose

JITOS exists because traditional computing models—based on mutable files, random access memory, and imperative state mutation—break catastrophically under:

- concurrency
- distributed computation
- AI-driven automation
- simulation-scale reasoning
- machine agency
- multi-tenant workflows
- arbitrary branching and rewrites
- scientific reproducibility
- adversarial settings

The old model treats a computer like:

- a desk
- a folder
- a stack of papers
- a single-user scratchpad

JITOS treats a computer like:

- a time machine
- a causal spacetime fabric
- a multi-world simulation substrate
- a truth-maintaining universe
- a safe environment for autonomous agents

It is a post-file operating system built for:

- AI agents
- distributed teams
- scientific workflows
- deterministic automation
- complex multi-stage pipelines
- massively parallel thought
- new programming paradigms
- post-human-scale computation

## 1.3 What JITOS is Not

To clarify the system’s positioning:

JITOS is not:

- a version control tool
- a Git wrapper
- a framework
- a database
- a message bus
- a CRDT system
- a file-based OS
- a log-based hack

JITOS is:

- a full kernel
- a causal substrate
- an execution environment
- a semantic universe
- a multi-agent architecture
- a deterministic state machine
- a principled replacement for the filesystem
- a computational physics engine
- the practical implementation of CΩMPUTER theory

## 1.4 Kernel Components (High-Level)

JITOS consists of the following high-level subsystems:

- Causal DAG (Truth) — permanent state
- SWS (Process Model) — isolated worlds for computation
- Inversion Engine — deterministic merge/collapse
- WAL — time axis + replay
- Materialized Head — human-readable projection
- Storage Tiering — thermal dynamics of node retention
- RPC/ABI — syscall layer
- Security Model — agent identity, permissions
- Distributed Sync — frontier negotiation
- Federation — inter-universe linking
- Provenance — semantic and scientific lineage
- Message Plane — multi-agent orchestration

Each subsystem is backed by one or more RFCs and formalized via ADRs.

## 1.5 Architectural Consequence of ADR-0001

[ADR-0001](../ADR/ADR-0001.md) asserts:

> JIT is the operating system kernel for JITOS.

This decision results in:

- JITD running as the kernel daemon
- SWS treated as first-class processes
- DAG as memory + history
- commit as the core system call
- MH as a compatibility filesystem
- RPC/ABI as the syscall interface
- security/identity determining permissions
- federation enabling cross-universe architecture

Every subsequent component in the architecture doc must be consistent with this worldview.

This is the root decision that anchors the entire architecture.

## 1.6 Summary

JITOS is a causal-first operating system where:

- state is history
- processes are shadows
- commit is collapse
- memory is a DAG
- truth is immutable
- the filesystem is an illusion
- computation is geometry

The world after Ω₀ is the post-file era.
