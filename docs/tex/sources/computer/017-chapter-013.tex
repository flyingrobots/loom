\#\# \textbf{Choosing one worldline from many.}

By now, we've seen:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{bundles} --- clusters of legal futures,
\item
  \textbf{interference} --- how those futures constrain each other,
\item
  \textbf{curvature} --- how structure shapes possibility,
\item
  \textbf{geodesics} --- optimal paths through rewrite space.
\end{itemize}

Now we ask the big question:

\begin{quote}
\textbf{How does a system choose ONE future out of the structured cloud
of possibilities?}
\end{quote}

How does Chronos pick a single line through the expanding cone of
Kairos?

How does the runtime turn \textbf{``could''} into \textbf{``did''}?

This is \textbf{collapse}.

Not quantum. Not random. Not spooky. Not metaphysical.

Just:

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Selecting the next state by choosing the shortest or most
consistent rewrite from an interacting bundle.}
\end{quote}

Let's make that idea precise.

\section{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{13.1 --- Collapse is Selection, Not
Destruction}}{13.1 --- Collapse is Selection, Not Destruction}}\label{collapse-is-selection-not-destruction}

When the runtime collapses a rewrite bundle, it is NOT:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  destroying futures,
\item
  performing probabilistic choice,
\item
  picking randomly,
\item
  ``measuring'' in a quantum sense.
\end{itemize}

It is simply:

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Choosing one legal DPO rewrite that satisfies consistency,
priority, and minimality.}
\end{quote}

All other futures remain \textbf{nearby universes} in Rulial Space ---
but they are no longer part of the active worldline. They're like roads
you \emph{didn't} take, but that still exist on the map.

Collapse = selection. Selection = motion. Motion = worldline
advancement.

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{0.5pt}\end{center}

\section{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{13.2 --- Minimal Path
Collapse}}{13.2 --- Minimal Path Collapse}}\label{minimal-path-collapse}

Given a bundle of choices:

\begin{lstlisting}
   Possible futures
      / |  |  \
     /  |  |   \
    {\bfseries ?}{\textemdash}{\bfseries ?}{\textemdash}{\bfseries ?}{\textemdash}{\bfseries ?}{\textemdash}{\bfseries ?}{\textemdash}{\bfseries ?}
\end{lstlisting}

the runtime applies a simple rule:

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Choose the rewrite with minimal Rulial Distance relative to the
intended path (or priority constraints).}
\end{quote}

This ``intended path'' could be:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  the geodesic (optimal path),
\item
  a target structure,
\item
  a semantic invariant,
\item
  a type constraint,
\item
  a scheduler priority,
\item
  or even an external observer directive.
\end{itemize}

Minimal path collapse ensures:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  consistency
\item
  determinism
\item
  convergence
\item
  predictable behavior
\item
  stable worldlines
\end{itemize}

This is the computational analog of:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  greedy evaluation in reduction semantics
\item
  shortest-reduction in lambda calculus
\item
  most local rewrite in term rewriting
\item
  optimal lowering in compilers
\item
  minimal fixup in type inference
\item
  canonical ordering in version control merges
\end{itemize}

But here, it's \textbf{geometric.}

The ``closest'' future wins.

\section{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{13.3 --- Legal Collapse: The Role of
K-Interfaces}}{13.3 --- Legal Collapse: The Role of K-Interfaces}}\label{legal-collapse-the-role-of-k-interfaces}

A rewrite only collapses if:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  its \textbf{L-pattern} matches the current RMG,
\item
  its \textbf{K-interface} can be preserved,
\item
  its \textbf{R-pattern} can be safely inserted,
\item
  no dangling edges would result,
\item
  no invariants are violated.
\end{itemize}

Collapse is not ``pick your favorite.''

Collapse is:

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Choose the cheapest legal future that preserves the universe's
invariants.}
\end{quote}

This is why collapse is stable.

It never picks an illegal universe. It never picks a chaotic universe.
It never picks nonsense.

\section{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{13.4 --- Collapse as Constraint
Satisfaction}}{13.4 --- Collapse as Constraint Satisfaction}}\label{collapse-as-constraint-satisfaction}

Collapse acts like a solver:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Find all legal futures
\item
  Discard incompatible futures
\item
  Apply priorities (structural, rule-based, context-based)
\item
  Pick the cheapest rewrite
\item
  Advance the worldline
\end{itemize}

This is a \textbf{constraint satisfaction problem} with a single
selected solution.

Not randomness. Not magic.

Just:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  legality
\item
  minimality
\item
  consistency
\end{itemize}

The runtime is not choosing arbitrarily --- it's navigating the
curvature of the local Rulial Surface.

\section{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{13.5 --- Collapse and
Interference}}{13.5 --- Collapse and Interference}}\label{collapse-and-interference}

In the previous chapter, we saw:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  bundles can conflict,
\item
  bundles can reinforce,
\item
  bundles can carve each other's shape.
\end{itemize}

Collapse is where this structure crystallizes.

When bundles interfere:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  destructive interference removes illegal futures
\item
  constructive interference narrows choices to stable ones
\item
  the stable ``attractors'' win
\end{itemize}

This is why well-designed systems ``naturally converge.'' Their rules
interfere constructively.

This is why fragile systems explode. Their rules interfere
destructively.

Collapse makes this visible.

\section{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{13.6 --- Collapse is the Deterministic
Arrow of
Computation}}{13.6 --- Collapse is the Deterministic Arrow of Computation}}\label{collapse-is-the-deterministic-arrow-of-computation}

Collapse gives computation a direction.

Before collapse:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  many possible futures
\item
  many adjacent universes
\item
  many bundles of rewrites
\end{itemize}

After collapse:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  exactly one next world
\item
  exactly one tick
\item
  exactly one continuation
\item
  exactly one Chronos step
\end{itemize}

This is the \textbf{arrow}:

\begin{lstlisting}
BUNDLE {\textrightarrow} collapse {\textrightarrow} WORLDLINE ADVANCES
\end{lstlisting}

It is the fundamental mechanism of:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  control flow
\item
  execution
\item
  scheduling
\item
  evaluation order
\item
  interpreter semantics
\item
  compiler lowering
\item
  runtime determinism
\end{itemize}

Collapse is the beating heart of computation.

\section{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{13.7 --- Collapse as Information Loss
(Structured)}}{13.7 --- Collapse as Information Loss (Structured)}}\label{collapse-as-information-loss-structured}

Collapse discards:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  most futures,
\item
  most rewrites,
\item
  most bundles,
\item
  most local possibilities
\end{itemize}

This is NOT entropy. This is NOT uncertainty. This is NOT quantum. This
is NOT probability.

This is:

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Choosing one path out of a structured set and discarding the
others because they violate consistency or minimality.}
\end{quote}

The information lost is just the ``forks'' you didn't take.

They remain as \emph{neighbors} in Rulial Space, but not in Chronos.

\section{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{13.8 --- Collapse \& Optimal
Computation}}{13.8 --- Collapse \& Optimal Computation}}\label{collapse-optimal-computation}

Collapse isn't just deterministic.

Collapse is the mechanism by which:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  optimization emerges,
\item
  canonical forms arise,
\item
  normalization stabilizes,
\item
  evaluation converges,
\item
  consistent semantics appear.
\end{itemize}

Because collapse picks:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  the minimal path,
\item
  the legal path,
\item
  the consistent path.
\end{itemize}

It's not heuristic. It's geometric.

\section{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{FOR THE
NERDS{\texttrademark}}}{FOR THE NERDS{\texttrademark}}}\label{for-the-nerds}

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{Collapse, Confluence, and Canonical
Forms}}{Collapse, Confluence, and Canonical Forms}}\label{collapse-confluence-and-canonical-forms}

Collapse is deeply related to:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  confluence (Church--Rosser),
\item
  critical pair resolution,
\item
  weak/strong normalization,
\item
  orthogonality,
\item
  peak reduction,
\item
  left-linear rules,
\item
  standardization theorems.
\end{itemize}

But C\ensuremath{\Omega}MPUTER extends those concepts:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  bundles = peak sets
\item
  interference = critical pairs
\item
  minimal path = standardization
\item
  worldline = reduction sequence
\item
  geometry = metric on confluence classes
\end{itemize}

Collapse is confluence sharpened by geometry.

\emph{(End sidebar.)}

\section{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{13.9 --- Transition: From Collapse to
the Arrow of
Computation}}{13.9 --- Transition: From Collapse to the Arrow of Computation}}\label{transition-from-collapse-to-the-arrow-of-computation}

Now we've explained:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  bundles,
\item
  interference,
\item
  collapse.
\end{itemize}

But why does collapse \emph{always} move forward?

Why can't we un-collapse? Rewind time? Undo computation?

Turns out:

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Reversibility and irreversibility are structural, emergent
properties of the RMG universe.}
\end{quote}

And that\ldots{}

is \textbf{Chapter 14}.
