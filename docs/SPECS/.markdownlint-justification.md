# Markdownlint Configuration

## Disabled Rules

### MD013 (line-length)

**Rationale:** MD013 line-length violations are disabled for SPEC documents because:

1. **Code Examples**: Rust function signatures and type definitions often exceed 80 characters when properly formatted
2. **Technical Accuracy**: Breaking lines in code examples can make them syntactically invalid or harder to copy-paste
3. **Readability**: Technical documentation benefits from natural line breaks rather than forced wrapping
4. **Already Fixed**: All other markdown issues (MD022, MD031, MD032, MD036, MD040) have been addressed

**Configuration:** See `.markdownlint.json` in the repository root.
